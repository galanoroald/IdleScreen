# Idle Screen

Why? Because why not, i'm bored and unemployed.

# What's going on here?

What's going on here is the amazing and surprisingly easy to learn Javascript 3D library.<br>
https://threejs.org/ - Link for three.js<br>

basically watched a few tutorials just to create my own mess of a content despite my incompetence in programming

In the end, this project of mine is just merely a hobby, nothing else, nothing more....
However, I plan on updating this crap once in a while, if I ever get bored or something.

# How do you feel?

I feel tired...
but, in regards to three.js, i'm actually surprised this thing is easy to learn and stuff.

DISCLAIMER!!!
I do not in any way get paid for this nor I do not sponsor this mini-project.
